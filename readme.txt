A square maze of a given size with starting point 'A' and goal point 'B' can be generated with the maze_generator.cpp.
That generated maze with 'A' and 'B' starting and goal points respectively, can be solved with the maze_solver.cpp.

Example generated and solved mazes are available in generated_maze.txt and solved_maze.txt files.

Note:
  the size of a maze should be an odd value larger than 4.
  '1' is used to denote walls and '0' is used to denote the paths.
  '#' is used to denote the path to solve the maze.
